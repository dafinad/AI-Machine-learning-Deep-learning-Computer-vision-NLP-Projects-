# Color Detection using Pandas & OpenCV

Color detection is the process of identifying the name of any color by comparing the RGB values of the clicked point in an image to a predefined list of colors. This can be implemented using a CSV file that contains a list of color names and their corresponding RGB values. The application calculates the distance between the clicked color and each color in the data file to identify the name of the closest match.

Colors are made up of 3 primary colors: red; green; blue. 
In computers, we define each color value within the range 0 - 255. Define a color by 256* 256 *256 =16,581375. Approximately 16.5 million different ways to represent a color.

In the dataset containing RGB values, we need to match each color's values with their corresponding names.
# Libraries
* OpenCV: For image processing
* Pandas: To handle the color data file.
